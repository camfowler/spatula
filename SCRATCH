Next steps:


1. Support generation of any twitter account
https://twitrss.me/twitter_user_to_rss/?user=donnahay

2. Store a key instead of a hash, so the url can change, and the timestamp is ok.

3. Have a per feed subclass that allows overriding the parsing logic. E.g., donnahay sometimes posts things that are not recipes. All her recipes live under donnahay.com.au/recipes, so can validate with that first.
